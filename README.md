robotframework-oimclientlibrary
=============

A Java based Robot Framework library for Oracle Identity Manager testing.

Description
-----------

OimClientLibrary is a library for Robot Framework that provides keywords for
interacting with the Oracle Identity Manager product (OIM). The [official OIM 11g
API](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E40329_01/dev.1112/e27150/apis.htm) is used.

Documentation for currently available keywords is in the doc directory (generated by libdoc).

Dependencies
------------

- Oracle's proprietary OimClient (oimclient.zip), included in the OIM installation (see the [official docs](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E40329_01/dev.1112/e27150/apis.htm#OMDEV2834))
- WebLogic's wlfucllclient.jar (see the [official docs](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E40329_01/dev.1112/e27150/apis.htm#OMDEV2834))
- [Javalib Core](https://github.com/robotframework/JavalibCore)

Installation
------------

Either download the latest [release](http://maven-repository-jrkoiter.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/release/nl/fuselogic/robotframework-oimclientlibrary/) or [snapshot](http://maven-repository-jrkoiter.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/snapshot/nl/fuselogic/robotframework-oimclientlibrary/) version, or build the library from source by following the steps below. A working Maven installation is assumed:

1. Obtain and unzip oimclient.zip into a directory
2. Get the source of the robotframework-oimclientlibrary (ie. this library)
3. Import the oimclient.jar file into a new local Maven repository (which is referenced in the pom file):

		mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.3.1:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/oimclient/oimclient.jar -DgroupId=oracle.iam.platform -DartifactId=oimclient -Dversion=11.1.2.2.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=/path/to/robotframework-oimclientlibrary/my-repo

4. Build the library. It will be generated in the subdirectory "target".

		mvn package

Usage
-----

1. Obtain and unzip oimclient.zip into a directory
2. Obtain and copy wlfullclient.jar into /path/to/oimclient/lib
3. Obtain the [Javalib Core](https://github.com/robotframework/JavalibCore) library
4. Add "OimClientLibrary" to your test suite's Settings table, e.g:
   
        *** Settings ***
        | Library | nl.fuselogic.robotframework.libraries.oim.OimClientLibrary |

5. Run your test suites using Jython/jybot with the following Java system property set

		-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/path/to/oimclient/conf/authwl.conf

	and with all libraries in the classpath

		robotframework-oimclientlibrary-*.jar
		javalib-core-1.1.jar
		wlfullclient.jar
		oimclient.jar
		/path/to/oimclient/lib/*
        iam-platform-utils.jar
        ipf.jar

6. Alternatively, deploy "OimClientLibrary" to a [jrobotremoteserver](https://github.com/ombre42/jrobotremoteserver), and keep running your tests in pybot. Library definition in your tests will then be something like:
        
        *** Settings ***
        | Library | Remote | http://localhost:8270/ | With Name | OimLibrary |
